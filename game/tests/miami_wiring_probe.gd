## Runtime wiring probe for the main playable map.
##
## The smoke test only advances one frame per scene, so it proves miami.tscn
## boots but not that the gameplay simulation actually connects. This boots
## miami.tscn, lets it run long enough for the streaming directors to tick at
## least once, then asserts the self-wiring system nodes registered with their
## groups (so the live HUD has data) and the dynamic directors are present and
## found the player. Run headless:
##   godot --headless --path game --script res://tests/miami_wiring_probe.gd
