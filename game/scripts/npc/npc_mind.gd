class_name NpcMind
extends RefCounted
## The deliberative decision layer that makes a citizen feel alive: it fuses the
## scripted daily routine (NpcSchedule) with live drives (NpcNeeds) and
## personality, and emits a single concrete intent — "go here and do this,
## because...". This sits *above* the reflexive NpcBrain wander/flee FSM: NpcMind
## decides where in its day a citizen belongs; NpcBrain handles the moment-to-
## moment locomotion and panic once it gets there.
##
## The routine is the baseline. But a drive that gets desperate enough crosses
## the NPC's personal interrupt threshold and hijacks the plan: the diligent
## accountant who suddenly *has* to find a toilet, the bored intern who ditches
## work for the park the instant fun bottoms out. That tension between schedule
## and need is what reads, from the sidewalk, as a person with an inner life.
##
## Pure decision math (state in, intent out), scene-free, unit-tested headless
## (tests/unit/test_npc_mind.gd).

## Default urgency at which a drive overrides the schedule. Personality shifts it.
const OVERRIDE_THRESHOLD: float = 0.7

## Which activity / place resolves each drive when it boils over.
const NEED_ACTIVITY: Dictionary = {
	"energy": {"activity": "sleep", "place": "home"},
	"hunger": {"activity": "eat", "place": "diner"},
	"social": {"activity": "socialize", "place": "bar"},
	"fun": {"activity": "goof_off", "place": "park"},
	"hygiene": {"activity": "freshen_up", "place": "restroom"},
}


## Decide what this NPC does at `hour` given its routine, drives and personality.
##
## personality keys (all optional, default 0):
##   "discipline" in [-1, 1] — how stubbornly it sticks to the schedule. A
##     disciplined NPC tolerates more discomfort before bailing; a flake bails
##     at the first twinge.
##
## Returns {activity, place, reason, urgency}. `reason` is "schedule" or
## "need:<drive>" so debug HUD / dialogue can explain the choice.
