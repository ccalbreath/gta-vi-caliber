class_name BuildingDoors
extends RefCounted
## Spawns "Enter" doors on a district's enterable buildings (named, or a public-
## facing OSM type). Static like DistrictFacadePanels so district_loader stays a
## thin orchestrator: Enterable picks the subset and the door point, each door is
## a BuildingDoor that hands off to BuildingInterior for the fade and the room.

## Doors per district (caps interiors so a dense district doesn't carpet the
## street) and the trigger height above the pavement.
const MAX_DOORS: int = 14
const DOOR_Y: float = 1.2


## Add an enter-door under `loader` for each enterable building. `proj` projects
## footprints into the loader's local metre frame (the same frame as the meshes).
