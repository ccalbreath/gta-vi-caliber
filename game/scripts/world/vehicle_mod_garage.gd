class_name VehicleModGarage
extends Area3D
## Drive-in tuning garage: park the car you're driving on the garage floor and the
## next affordable performance upgrade is bought against your wallet and applied
## live to that car. Each vehicle keeps its own upgrade levels (a VehicleModShop
## per car, keyed by node name), so a tuned car stays tuned and a second car starts
## stock. Consumes the tested VehicleModShop model and self-wires by group
## (player_stats); it detects the driven car through the "vehicles" group on body
## entry — the same enter/exit/has_driver contract player.gd uses — so it needs no
## plumbing beyond an Area3D + CollisionShape3D placed over the garage floor.
##
## Cars drive on collision layer 1 (car_physics.tscn) and the player is hidden on
## layer 0 while driving, so the body that trips this zone is the car itself.
