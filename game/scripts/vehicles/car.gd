class_name Car
extends VehicleBody3D
## Greybox drivable car. Idle until a driver enters (Player calls enter()), then
## reads move input as throttle/steer. Steering math is delegated to
## VehicleMotion and the engine/gearbox to Powertrain — both pure and
## unit-tested. The drivetrain runs a real torque curve through a multi-speed
## auto-shifting gearbox, so acceleration falls off as each gear tops out and
## recovers on the upshift, instead of one flat pull to top speed.

## Below this forward speed (m/s) a press of "back" engages reverse; above it the
## same press brakes the still-forward-rolling car instead.
