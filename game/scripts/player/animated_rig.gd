## Skeletal character rig driven by an AnimationTree state machine.
##
## The player's replacement for the procedural CharacterAnimator (issue #1):
## same animate() input contract fed by Player after move_and_slide. Imported
## CC0 clips play on a hidden Quaternius source skeleton, then Godot 4.6's
## RetargetModifier3D transfers those poses to the selected production visual.
## This keeps locomotion clips reusable across player and pedestrian models.

## Fired when a locomotion clip plants a foot on the ground. Player listens
## and re-emits its surface-typed `footstep` signal, so step audio is locked
## to the animation's actual foot strikes instead of a parallel stride clock.
