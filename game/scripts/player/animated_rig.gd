extends Node3D
## Skeletal character rig driven by an AnimationTree state machine.
##
## The player's replacement for the procedural CharacterAnimator (issue #1):
## same animate() input contract fed by Player after move_and_slide, but the
## pose comes from imported CC0 clips (Quaternius Universal Animation
## Library) playing on the Universal Base Character skeleton. This script
## sits on the imported model's root (see character_rig.tscn), so animation
## method tracks reach it at path "." for foot-plant events. Routing from
## locomotion state to state-machine target is pure logic in AnimRouter;
## state classification stays in Locomotion, so both are unit-tested without
## this scene.

## Fired when a locomotion clip plants a foot on the ground. Player listens
## and re-emits its surface-typed `footstep` signal, so step audio is locked
## to the animation's actual foot strikes instead of a parallel stride clock.
signal foot_planted(is_left: bool)

## imported animations resolve against our Model without retargeting.
