class_name HitContract
extends RefCounted
## Pure assassination-contract board — the genre's signature "do the hit, move the
## market" loop (GTA V's Lester assassinations): each contract names a target, pays
## a reward, and on completion emits a STOCK-MARKET SHOCK the caller applies to a
## StockMarket, so the player can invest first and cash in on the swing. Distinct
## from SideJob (quick taxi/delivery/vigilante odd-jobs): these are premeditated,
## single-target, market-moving hits offered from a board.
##
## Deliberately decoupled from StockMarket: complete() returns a {company_id,
## magnitude, spillover} effect descriptor and the caller feeds it to
## StockMarket.apply_rivalry_shock — the contract model never imports the market,
## so both stay independently unit-tested headless
## (tests/unit/test_hit_contract.gd).
##
## A contract is a Dictionary {id, target, company_id, magnitude, spillover,
## reward, difficulty}. Malformed entries (missing/empty id, non-positive reward)
## are dropped at construction. One contract is active at a time; finished ones
## leave the available pool.

## id -> contract Dictionary. Insertion-ordered.
var _contracts: Dictionary = {}

## Currently accepted contract id, or "" when none is active.
var _active: String = ""

## Set of completed contract ids (id -> true).
var _completed: Dictionary = {}

## Lifetime reward cash earned from completed hits.
