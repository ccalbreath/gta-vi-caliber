# GTA-VI-caliber

**A community-driven, fully open-source open-world game.** Our quality bar is the
fidelity shown in modern AAA open-world trailers: a dense, living coastal city
with seamless streaming, vehicles, crowds, water, and weather. Built on
[Godot 4](https://godotengine.org) with custom C++ engine modules where the
engine needs to be pushed further.

> ⚠️ This is an original, unaffiliated community project. It is **not**
> associated with Rockstar Games or Take-Two Interactive, and contains no
> assets, code, or content from any Grand Theft Auto product. "GTA-VI-caliber"
> describes our *quality benchmark*, nothing more.

## Quickstart (60 seconds)

```bash
# 1. Install Godot 4.6+ and git-lfs
brew install --cask godot && brew install git-lfs && git lfs install
#    (Linux/Windows: download Godot 4.6 from https://godotengine.org/download)

# 2. Clone
git clone https://github.com/duolahypercho/gta-vi-caliber.git
cd gta-vi-caliber

# 3. Play — boots straight into the one map, no editor needed:
godot --path game
#    — or open it in the Godot editor and press F5:
godot --path game --editor
```

There is **one map** and it boots straight into play — no menus, no scene
picker. The command above (or pressing F5 in the editor) drops you into the
streaming Vice City world, ready to walk, drive, and trigger the wanted system.

### Controls

## Project status

🟢 **Playable.** Launching the game drops you straight into a single streaming
Vice City map: a third-person character, drivable vehicles, traffic and crowds,
and the core GTA loop wired end to end (commit crimes → wanted stars → police
dispatch → evade or get busted), plus missions and a property/economy layer.
See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for what's next.
