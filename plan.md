# PLAN — Can a swarm of AI agents build GTA VI before Rockstar ships it?

**This is an experiment, framed as a plan.** The real question underneath all
the milestones below is a research question:

> **Can a branching swarm of Claude / Codex coding agents, working continuously
> under one shared contract, build a GTA-VI-caliber open-world game — and how
> far can they get before the real GTA VI actually releases?**

The deadline is the experiment's clock: **GTA VI itself.** Whatever this repo
looks like the day Rockstar ships is the result. We are not racing them to
*win* — they have ~1000 people and a decade (probably also have whole branch clade /codex running). We are measuring **how close an
autonomous AI agent fleet gets**, on an open engine, with original assets, from
a standing start. That number — and everything we learn making it as high as
possible — is the actual deliverable.

So this document is two things at once:

1. **The experiment's protocol** — the hypothesis, the conditions, what counts
   as a result (§0).
2. **The build plan the agents execute** — the path from the current build to a
   finished open-world game in the spirit of GTA VI (original IP, Vice City /
   Miami setting), as phased milestones with hard exit gates (§2 onward).

It sits **above** [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) — the roadmap is the live
task board (M0–M6); this file is the strategy, the honest scope, and the cut
line.

> Steering rule: when this plan and `docs/ROADMAP.md` disagree, fix one of them
> in the same PR. Agents read both. Keep tasks small, concrete, verifiable.

## 0. The experiment — read this first

### Hypothesis

A fleet of AI agents, branching and merging under a single playable-trunk
contract ([[multi-agent-swarm-setup]]), can take an open engine (Godot 4.6) and
autonomously produce a coherent, shippable, GTA-inspired open-world game — and
the honest ceiling of what they reach is set by **content volume and renderer
hardware, not by the agents' ability to design and wire systems.**

### Conditions of the experiment

- **The clock:** the public release of the real GTA VI. Wherever this repo is on
  that day is the recorded result — tag it, capture a trailer, write it up.
- **The fleet:** multiple Claude / Fable agents on lane discipline, steered by
  humans editing this file and `docs/ROADMAP.md` — the roadmap is the shared
  steering wheel, not per-task prompting.
- **The rules that make the result honest** (these *are* the experiment, not
  bureaucracy): `main` always runs; every wired feature ships with a runtime
  probe; original assets only with provenance; native code only with a captured
  profile. An agent fleet that cheats these produces a result that means nothing.
- **What we measure:** how far up each axis below the fleet climbs (systems
  feel, visual fidelity, content scale, "is it a finished game") before the
  clock runs out — plus the meta-result: *what did building it teach us about
  agent swarms doing long-horizon, multi-month creative engineering?*

### Why it's a good experiment

It is long-horizon (months, not one session), multi-agent (coordination under
merge races), creative *and* technical (art direction + C++ streaming), and it
has a **brutally objective yardstick** — the actual GTA VI — that no amount of
self-grading can fudge. Most agent benchmarks are toy tasks with easy oracles;
this one is open-ended, adversarial against reality, and the gap is measurable
in screenshots. Win or lose, the delta is the data.

### Honest scope — what "as far as possible" realistically means

A *literal* "complete GTA 6" is a ~1000-person, multi-year, nine-figure
production: ~50 hours of bespoke narrative, full voice cast, motion-capture,
licensed radio, online services. The fleet is not pretending to match that
headcount. The result the fleet is actually driving toward, and what "complete"
means for this experiment:

- A **finished, coherent, shippable game** — title screen to credits — not a
  tech demo. It has a beginning, a playable middle, and an end.
- **One living coastal city** (Miami / Vice City) streamed seamlessly, dense
  with traffic and crowds, that holds 60 FPS on a mid-range GPU.
- A **6–10 hour critical path**: a story campaign of hand-built missions, plus
  systemic open-world play (heat/police, side jobs, economy, properties) that
  makes the city replayable for far longer.
- **Trailer-grade fidelity within the engine's honest ceiling** (~6–7/10 vs
  the real GTA VI trailer — see [[godot-fidelity-ceiling]]). The gap that
  remains is content volume and hardware ray-tracing, not a missing system.

### The realistic target, stated plainly

This plan **cannot and does not aim to clone GTA VI.** Rockstar spent ~$1–2B and
1000+ people over ~7 years on bespoke content *volume* — hundreds of unique
interiors, thousands of voiced lines, mocap, a 50-hour story, a full licensed
map. No multi-agent loop out-produces that, and no software renderer without
hardware ray-tracing matches that look in a side-by-side.

What is **actually achievable by following this plan** — and what we hold
ourselves to — is a top-tier *indie-AAA, GTA-inspired* game:

- **Systems feel: 8–9/10.** Heat/police, traffic, reactive crowds, economy,
  missions, driving — this is where the parts bin already puts us in the game's
  league. This is our strongest card; lean on it.
- **Visual fidelity: 6–7/10 vs the trailer.** Reachable with art direction and
  density, not a renderer miracle. We close the *perceived* gap, not the
  hardware one.
- **Content scale: a fraction of Rockstar's, by design.** One city, a 6–10 hr
  critical path, a small bespoke cast — finished and coherent, not vast.

The bet is: **win on systems and a tight, polished slice; concede on raw scale
and last-percent fidelity.** A finished, fun, original open-world game that
genuinely plays like its inspiration is a rare outcome almost no open-source
project reaches. That is the prize — not a 1:1 replica.

The acceptance test is unchanged from [`docs/VISION.md`](docs/VISION.md): **a
90-second in-engine trailer captured from a release build that looks like the
game it claims to be**, plus a player completing the campaign start to finish
without falling out of the world.

If a feature does not move us toward that acceptance test, it is out of scope
for v1.0 and goes to the Post-launch section.

---

## 1. Where we are now (state snapshot — 2026-06)

What exists and works (verified by the repo, not aspiration):

- **Playable trunk.** `miami.tscn` is a fully wired playable game loop, each
  step CI-guarded by a runtime probe (`miami_*_probe.gd`): player
  health/stats/wanted/mission/bark, crowd + traffic + police directors, crime →
  wanted → police dispatch, a 5-mission campaign paying money/respect/stats,
  pay-n-spray wanted-clear, busted/arrest fail-loop. See [[miami-playable-and-systems]].
- **A deep systems library** — 40+ pure, unit-tested simulation models (314
  unit tests) catalogued in [`docs/SYSTEMS.md`](docs/SYSTEMS.md): ballistics,
  pursuit, witness, handling, explosions, crowd panic, economy, heists,
  progression, weather, radio. Many are **built and tested but not yet wired**
  into the live scene — see [[sim-systems-library]].
- **Character & traversal.** Third-person locomotion (accel/decel, coyote time,
  jump buffering), collision-probe camera, footstep audio, partial gamepad. A
  premium rigged player (Mara) with a pixel-level capture-gate workflow
  ([[mara-character-capture-and-gating]]).
- **Atmosphere.** Procedural sky + day/night cycle ([[sky-daynight-system]]),
  cinematic environment, facade/window night-lighting, Ocean v1, procedural
  terrain ([[terrain-system]]).
- **World geography.** Causeways + Biscayne Bay islands + palms stitching the
  districts into one continuous Florida map ([[bay-geography-subsystems]]).
- **Engine track.** `engine/` GDExtension (`worldcore`) compiles on all 3
  platforms with C++ tests in CI; godot-cpp vendored as a submodule.
- **The gate.** `tools/check.sh` = CI (format, lint, import, smoke, unit,
  runtime probes). `main` always runs.

What is **deliberately mid-flight on this branch** (`feat/fidelity-engine-sprints`):
the LA → Miami pivot ([[vice-city-pivot]]) — legacy `los_angeles_*` and demo
scenes are being retired; `miami.tscn` is the one canonical world scene.

**Honest gap to "complete":** we have a *vertical slice* of a game (one wired
loop, one district's worth of systems) and a deep parts bin. We do **not** yet
have: streaming at city scale, content *volume* (one district vs a full map; 5
missions vs a campaign), narrative spine, full UI/UX shell, audio/radio
content, save/load durability, and a ship/packaging pipeline.

---

## 2. The shape of the plan

Eight phases. Phases A–C harden and scale what exists; D–F add the content and
play that make it a *game*; G–H polish and ship. They overlap — the engine
track and content track run in parallel with gameplay — but the **exit
criteria** are sequential gates: don't start a phase's polish before its
predecessor's gate is green.

```
A. Stabilize & consolidate ──┐
B. Streaming world at scale ─┼─→ D. Content volume ─────→ F. Play-loop framework ──┐
C. Wire the parts bin ───────┘    E. Life & atmosphere ─┘                          ├─→ G. Polish ──→ H. Ship 1.0
                                                                                    │
   Track N. Narrative/voice/audio ─── slow production track, fills F's skeleton ────┤
   Track Q. Fidelity fine-tuning ───── continuous: detail/texture/movement/tone ────┤
   Engine track (worldcore) ───────────── runs throughout ──────────────────────────┘
```

Two **long poles** dominate the schedule and run as their own parallel
production tracks, not checkboxes: **Phase D (content volume)** and **Track N
(narrative/voice/audio)**. Everything else is faster than these two combined —
plan staffing and time around them.

Each phase below lists: **Goal**, **Tasks**, **Exit criteria** (the gate). Map
tasks back to roadmap milestones (M0–M6) where they correspond.

---

## Phase A — Stabilize & consolidate the pivot

*Goal: one clean canonical game, no legacy debt, a green gate on a clean clone.*

The Vice City pivot is half-applied on a feature branch. Finish it so every
later phase builds on solid ground.

- [ ] Land the pivot: retire all `los_angeles_*` / demo scenes, confirm
      `miami.tscn` is the only world entry point, update `docs/PIVOT_TO_MIAMI.md`.
- [ ] `main_menu` Play → `miami.tscn` (not the old sandbox) end to end.
- [ ] Resolve the open `LOOP_HANDOFF.md` items: gamepad **button** bindings in
      `project.godot`; rebindable-input persistence layer; route premium
      lighting (`CinematicEnvironment.enhance`) into the gameplay scene **gated
      behind a quality setting** (it was reverted on a 120→54 FPS perf hit — ship
      it for the dense district only, with a measured budget).
- [ ] Vendor gdUnit4 and port the unit runner (open M0 box) — or formally
      decide the current `run_tests.gd` harness is the standard and close it.
- [ ] CI builds + uploads Linux/Win/macOS artifacts on tag (confirm M0 box).

**Exit gate:** fresh clone → `tools/check.sh` green → `main_menu` → play the
full miami loop → quit, with zero references to retired scenes.

---

## Phase B — Streaming world at city scale  *(roadmap M3, engine track)*

*Goal: walk or drive ≥4 km in any direction with no loading screen, 60 FPS.*

This is the single biggest engineering risk and the thing that separates "a
level" from "an open world." It is the engine track's main event.

- [ ] World partitioned into tiles with seam-free LOD terrain.
- [ ] `engine/worldcore`: **async tile streamer** — load/unload around the
      camera, priority by velocity vector. Profile first; this is the proven
      case for native code.
- [ ] `engine/worldcore`: **runtime impostor baker** for distant buildings.
- [ ] Floating-origin shift at distance (confirm the existing implementation
      holds across the full map).
- [ ] Streaming debug HUD: tiles resident, VRAM, frame budget.
- [ ] Benchmark scene + captured profile checked into `docs/profiles/`,
      regression-gated.

**Exit gate:** a benchmark run drives a fixed 4 km transect of the full map
holding ≥60 FPS @ 1080p mid-range, no hitch > one frame budget on tile loads,
profile committed.

---

## Phase C — Wire the parts bin  *(roadmap M5, content of SYSTEMS.md)*

*Goal: every built-and-tested system is reachable in play, not just unit-tested.*

We have 40+ tested models; most are dark. This phase is mostly **integration,
not invention** — follow the self-wiring-coordinator pattern in
[`docs/SYSTEMS.md`](docs/SYSTEMS.md) (copy `MissionReward` / `PaySprayShop`).

- [ ] Combat wired live: `WeaponBallistics`, `ExplosionModel`, `MeleeCombat`,
      `CombatCover`, `StealthDetection`, `FirePropagation`.
- [ ] Vehicles: `VehicleHandling` drift, `VehicleHealth` → wreck → explosion,
      `VehicleModShop`, `Carjacking`, `GarageStorage`, `Parachute`.
- [ ] World-alive: `TrafficSignal` at junctions, `PedestrianTraffic` dodging,
      `EmergencyServices` dispatch, `WeatherEffects` feeding handling + AI sight.
- [ ] Economy/progression: `ShopModel`, `PropertyOwnership`, `ContrabandMarket`,
      `CasinoGames`, `PlayerProgression`, `StatTracker` (some already live).
- [ ] Police depth: `PoliceEscalation` tiers → SWAT/heli/military spawns,
      `PursuitTactics`, `GangTerritory` turf.
- [ ] Each newly wired system gets a runtime probe in `check.sh` like the
      existing `miami_*_probe` set — wiring without a probe doesn't count.

**Exit gate:** every system in `docs/SYSTEMS.md` is either wired-with-a-probe or
explicitly marked "v1.0 cut" with a reason. No silent dead systems.

---

## Phase D — Content volume  *(the long pole; roadmap M4 scaled up)*

*Goal: a full map, not one block; enough hand-built places to fill 6–10 hours.*

This is where a vertical slice becomes a game, and it is the **largest sustained
effort** in the plan. It is content production, parallelizable across agents.

- [ ] **The full Miami map**: 4–6 districts (downtown / South Beach / Little
      Havana / port / suburbs / keys), each with distinct silhouette, road
      layout, landmarks. Blockout → greybox → art pass per district.
- [ ] A **true road-graph** (OSM-style) replacing the baked walkability grid for
      traffic routing (the known M4 TODO).
- [ ] Interiors that matter: safehouses, shops, mission interiors, garages.
- [ ] Asset library scaled: building kit-of-parts, props, vehicle roster
      (currently a tuned mix — expand variety), pedestrian wardrobe.
- [ ] Original-asset provenance tracked in [`docs/ASSETS.md`](docs/ASSETS.md)
      for every file (hard rule — see [[codex-asset-generation]] for the
      texture pipeline).
- [ ] Map UI: minimap + full pause-map with streamed POIs (M5 box).

**Exit gate:** the whole map is drivable district-to-district seamlessly; a
fixed "grand tour" capture shows distinct, populated, lit districts with no
placeholder geometry on the critical path.

---

## Phase E — Life & atmosphere  *(roadmap M4/M6)*

*Goal: the city feels inhabited and worth screenshotting at any hour.*

Runs in parallel with D (different agents, different files).

- [ ] Crowds route *through* `NavGrid.find_path` (not straight wander) now that
      buildings are solid; add the gawk reaction (flee already exists).
- [ ] Traffic on the real road-graph; signals, intersections, jams.
- [ ] Weather fronts: clear → overcast → rain with wet-surface materials,
      feeding `WeatherEffects` into gameplay.
- [ ] Ocean v2: foam, wakes, buoyancy (engine candidate).
- [ ] Night-lighting pass per district; volumetrics tuned (the soup bug is
      fixed — keep it gated by time-of-day and quality setting).
- [ ] GPU-driven crowd density pass (engine track) once profiled.

**Exit gate:** day/night + weather capture set across all districts reads as
"alive" — reactive crowds, flowing traffic, screenshot-worthy night.

---

## Phase F — Narrative & the complete play loop  *(roadmap M5)*

*Goal: it has a story, a start, and an ending — a player can finish it.*

Systems give replayability; a **spine** gives it a reason to exist. This phase
hardens the *machinery*; the authored content that fills it is **Track N**
below — budget it as a separate, slow production track, not a checkbox here.

- [ ] **Mission framework hardened**: triggers, objectives, fail/retry,
      checkpoints, cutscene hooks (the 5-mission campaign is the seed —
      `MissionChain`/`MissionCampaign`).
- [ ] **The campaign skeleton**: a 15–30 mission arc *wired and playable* with
      placeholder dialogue/audio, an opening and a finale (a heist, wiring
      `HeistCrew`). Mocap is out of scope — procedural + keyframe.
- [ ] Side content: taxi/delivery/vigilante (`SideJob`), street races
      (`StreetRace`), properties, collectibles — the open-world filler.
- [ ] **Save/load** of world + player + mission state, durable across versions.
- [ ] Full UI/UX shell: title, settings, pause, map, phone
      ([[phone-system]]), HUD ([[game-hud-system]]) — coherent and complete.

**Exit gate:** a fresh player starts a new game, plays the campaign skeleton to
the credits (placeholder narrative OK), saves/reloads mid-way without
corruption, and the wanted/economy systems work throughout.

---

## Track N — Narrative, voice & audio content  *(a production track, not a feature)*

*Goal: the city has a soul — a story and voices worth caring about.*

**This is the second long pole, alongside Phase D — and the plan's biggest
honesty risk if treated as a feature.** GTA's *soul* is its writing, characters,
and radio, and that is enormous **authored** work that no system generates for
free. It runs as its own slow track in parallel with D/E/F and **fills the
campaign skeleton** once the framework (Phase F) holds it.

Scope it realistically — small and bespoke beats vast and hollow:

- [ ] **Story bible + cast**: a protagonist, 4–6 named characters, a Vice-City
      arc with a real ending. Write it before building missions around it.
- [ ] **Mission scripts**: scene-by-scene beats, objectives, and dialogue per
      campaign mission — authored, then dropped into the Phase F skeleton.
- [ ] **Voice**: realistically, synthesized/TTS or a tiny volunteer cast for
      v1.0 — *not* a full union cast. Pick the pipeline early; it gates timing.
- [ ] **Ambient barks**: pedestrian/cop/radio one-liners (the `bark` system
      exists) — a library, reactive to context.
- [ ] **Radio**: streaming channels with DJ/ad/news programming
      (`RadioScheduler`) on **CC-licensed or original** tracks only — licensing
      is a hard provenance rule, not an afterthought.
- [ ] **Audio mix as content**: music, SFX, and VO are authored assets with
      their own review pass, not engine settings.

**Exit gate:** the campaign skeleton from Phase F is filled with real authored
story, dialogue, and at least one fully-programmed radio channel; a playthrough
reads as *a story*, not a sequence of objectives.

> Reality note: if voice/writing capacity is the constraint (it usually is),
> **cut mission count before cutting quality** — 12 great authored missions beat
> 30 hollow ones. Scale the arc to the writing you can actually produce.

---

## Track Q — Fidelity fine-tuning  *(every axis, pushed toward GTA VI)*

*Goal: not "does the feature exist" but "does it feel like GTA VI" — tuned, by
eye and by ear, on every sensory and qualitative axis.*

The phases above make the game **exist**. This track makes it **close the gap**.
It is **continuous, not a phase** — it runs the whole way and never fully
"completes"; it is the refinement loop every other phase feeds into. The method
is the same on every axis: **put our output next to GTA VI reference, name the
specific delta, fix the highest-value one, re-capture, repeat.** Reference study
only — we study the *look and feel*, never copy assets ([[trailer-gap-roadmap]],
[[visual-realism-pipeline]]).

Per-axis target and how to push it:

- [ ] **Detail / set dressing.** GTA reads dense because every surface has
      intent — grime, signage, trash, wear, props with history. Push: per-
      district detail passes; kill flat untextured surfaces; add small-prop
      density and decals. Gate: no placeholder/flat geometry on the critical path.
- [ ] **Texture / material.** PBR with real roughness/normal/AO variation, wet
      vs dry, day vs night response. Push: a material-quality bar per surface
      class (road, facade, skin, car paint, water); upgrade the worst-scoring
      first. Use the texture pipeline in [[codex-asset-generation]]. Gate: side-
      by-side material capture rated ≥ GTA-adjacent on the hero surfaces.
- [ ] **Movement / animation feel.** This is where "AAA" lives — weight,
      momentum, foot-plant, transitions, ragdoll, camera that breathes. Push:
      locomotion blend tuning, IK foot-planting, vehicle weight/suspension feel,
      hit/impact reactions, no foot-sliding or pops. Gate: a movement-capture
      reel (walk/sprint/turn/enter-vehicle/combat) with no visible snap.
- [ ] **Humor / tone.** GTA's voice is satire — billboards, radio ads, NPC
      barks, mission writing that's funny and mean. This is a *writing* axis,
      owned with Track N. Push: a tone guide; satirical signage/ads/bark library;
      mission dialogue that lands jokes. Gate: a playtester laughs at least once
      unprompted.
- [ ] **Story / character.** Beyond "a plot exists" — characters with want and
      voice, pacing, set-piece missions, a memorable finale. Owned with Track N.
      Push: table-reads of mission scripts; cut beats that don't earn their time.
      Gate: a fresh player can name and describe the protagonist's arc afterward.
- [ ] **Audio feel.** Punchy weapons, throaty engines, a city that sounds alive,
      music that scores the moment. Push: layered SFX, spatialization, dynamic
      mix. Gate: eyes-closed, the soundscape reads as "a GTA city."
- [ ] **Lighting / atmosphere.** The single biggest perceived-fidelity lever
      (see Phase E/G). Push: golden-hour and neon-night grade per district,
      volumetrics, reflections. Gate: a night-and-dusk capture set that survives
      a side-by-side with the trailer's mood.

**Scoring loop (the engine of this track).** Keep the
trailer-gap score current ([[trailer-gap-roadmap]] starts it at ~2.3/10):
re-score after every meaningful pass, log the biggest remaining gap per axis,
and let the agent loop pull the top gap next. The score going up *is* the
experiment's primary metric.

**Honest ceiling (do not forget):** the asymptote is ~6–7/10 vs the real
trailer without hardware ray-tracing ([[godot-fidelity-ceiling]]). Fine-tuning
chases that ceiling on every axis; it does not break it. Diminishing returns are
real — when an axis stops moving the score, bank it and move to the next.

---

## Phase G — Trailer-grade polish  *(roadmap M6)*

*Goal: pass the acceptance test; lock performance.*

- [ ] Lighting master pass: GI (SDFGI/HDDAGI or an `engine/` solution)
      **gated by quality tier**, volumetrics, contact AO where it bites —
      respecting the measured perf budget from the M6 60-FPS target.
- [ ] Audio mix pass: spatialization, occlusion, music ducking, impact punch.
- [ ] Performance lockdown: 60 FPS @ 1080p mid-range, committed profiles,
      CI perf regression gate.
- [ ] Camera, animation, and transition polish; loading/streaming hidden.
- [ ] Accessibility + options: rebindable controls, subtitles, scalable UI.
- [ ] **Cut the 90-second in-engine trailer from a release build** — the final
      acceptance test from `docs/VISION.md`.

**Exit gate:** the trailer is captured from a tagged release build and looks
like the game; the perf profile is green and locked.

---

## Phase H — Ship 1.0

*Goal: a stranger can download it and play it to the end.*

- [ ] Packaging & signing for Linux/Win/macOS; one-click run.
- [ ] First-run onboarding, crash reporting, telemetry-free analytics opt-in.
- [ ] Bug-bash, soak test, save-compat freeze.
- [ ] Release notes, store/landing page, provenance/licensing audit
      (`LICENSE`, `LICENSE-ASSETS`, `docs/ASSETS.md` complete).
- [ ] Tag `v1.0`, publish builds, publish the trailer.

**Exit gate:** `v1.0` tagged; downloadable builds; a clean machine installs and
completes the campaign.

---

## 3. Engine track (`engine/worldcore`) — parallel, evidence-driven

Native code must justify itself with a **captured profile** before it's written
(rule in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)). Likely modules, in
priority order, gated by Phase B/D/E needs:

1. Async tile streamer (Phase B — the critical one).
2. Runtime impostor baker (Phase B).
3. Traffic/crowd simulation core (Phase C/E, only with profile evidence).
4. Ocean simulation (Phase E).
5. GPU-driven crowd rendering (Phase E/G).

Anything generically useful gets a Godot upstream PR the same week, logged in
[`docs/UPSTREAM.md`](docs/UPSTREAM.md). A permanent fork is a failure state.

---

## 4. How we work (the operating contract)

- **Playable trunk.** `main` always runs; `tools/check.sh` is the gate and = CI.
  Need gdtoolkit on `$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin` for the lint step.
- **Vertical slices over horizontal layers.** One drivable lit block beats ten
  systems at 40%.
- **GDScript first, C++ when profiled.**
- **Original assets only**, provenance for every file.
- **Every wired feature ships with a runtime probe.** No probe → doesn't count.
- **Multi-agent.** Several agents build this at once on lane discipline
  ([[multi-agent-swarm-setup]]); route shared-file changes
  (`project.godot`, `player.gd`, shared scenes) through the integrator — never
  path-commit a shared file holding someone else's uncommitted work
  (the `LOOP_HANDOFF.md` rule).
- **The roadmap is the steering wheel.** Humans edit `docs/ROADMAP.md` and this
  file to point the loops.

---

## 5. Reality check / known limits

The whole point of this section: **this plan is achievable only because it
concedes the things it cannot win.** Hold the line on every one of these.

- **Not a GTA VI clone — an indie-AAA game in its spirit.** Target ~6–7/10
  fidelity and a fraction of the scale (see §0, "The realistic target"). The
  win condition is *systems feel + a polished slice*, not parity.
- **Fidelity ceiling ~6–7/10 vs the trailer** without hardware RT
  ([[godot-fidelity-ceiling]]). Close the *perceived* gap with art direction and
  density, not a renderer miracle.
- **Two long poles, both production tracks, both slow:** Phase D (content
  volume) and Track N (narrative/voice/audio). Each takes longer than the
  engineering phases combined. The most common way this plan *fails* is
  underestimating one of them and shipping a hollow city or a hollow story.
- **Cut scope before cutting quality.** Fewer districts, fewer missions, a
  smaller cast — but each one finished. 12 great missions over 30 hollow ones;
  one stunning district over four placeholder ones.
- **Pick the voice/audio pipeline early** (TTS/synth or tiny volunteer cast for
  v1.0 — not a union cast). It gates mission timing and can't be bolted on late.
- **Scope discipline:** online/multiplayer, character creator, a second city,
  and a 50-hour narrative are **Post-launch**, not v1.0. Say no on the record.

## 6. Post-launch (explicitly out of v1.0)

Multiplayer/online · second city/map expansion · character creator ·
deeper RPG progression · mod/SDK support · console ports · licensed radio ·
mocap cutscene upgrade.

*Living document. Amend it in the same PR that makes it stale. Boxes check only
when the work is on `main`, passing CI, and playable.*
